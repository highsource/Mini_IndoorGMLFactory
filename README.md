# Mini_IndoorGMLFactory

You can build this project just as 'clean install'.
And run AppTest.java as 'Junit Test'.
Test is-can I get unmashalling result successfully. (So After get root element and check the gml ID of that.) 

My problem is, when I try to use locally built snapshot version at my project by adding dependency in eclipse, 
then my import pathes are all broken in my code. 
So previously I use online repository version.
And I also made push request with IndoorGML 1.0.3 schema(I only edited ogc.patch file as you explained to me.), so if you want, just refer that. 
Even I checked .m2 local repository and existence of settings.xml in my .m2 repository, I couldn't find why I cannot refer jar file at the outside of your project. Plz help me:( 
Anyway, thanks for your feedback.Really.
